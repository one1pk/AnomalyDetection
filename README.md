# Intrusion Detection in the US Power Grid 
This project experiments with behavioral intrusion detection on US electricity consumption data. The observed data was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to find the response variables that would best train a Hidden Markov Model. The best-fit HMM was found by comparing normalized log-likelihoods of training and test data. Finally, the anomalous data was tested against the model to see how normal the observations were. The injected anomalies were clearly detected, as the log-likelihood had a large difference from that of the trained data. This process demonstrates the effectiveness of real-time anomaly detection for the electrical supervisory control system.
